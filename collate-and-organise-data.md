# Organising and Forecasting Data

_**How did we organise the data?**_

The main tools used where Python, Big Query, Jupyter notebooks.

_**And to visualise the data?**_

 Pandas and Plotly for visualisation. The visualisations we created give us insights into historical developments and evolution of temperature and we can then use this to provide a possible outlook of how the future could be.

_**To forecast?**_
