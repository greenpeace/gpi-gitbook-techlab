# Gather Data

#### The Aim of the Game:

* Data was gathered around the office, with the main aim of finding trends that would achieve cost efficiency for our air conditioning system, for example.
* Gathering data in the office also meant that we could easily test the accuracy of the devices, crucial to the precision and efficiency of the project.&#x20;
* Finally, the provisional testing of these devices would prove or disprove the accuracy of the data recorded. Ultimately the aim would be to record data on a mass-scale, once consistent and reliable results were achieved.&#x20;

#### How we gathered data:

Having configured the device to output data at certain intervals, we had a few options. Either we could store the data locally on the machine or send the information to a database via wifi or a data connection. We considered two ways to do the latter:

* Through Google IoT integration - a highly reliable system, with data encryption.
* Through a get request - a highly unreliable system whereby anyone can access the data with no validation.&#x20;
